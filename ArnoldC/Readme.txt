This is an old OOP homework written in java that implements an interpreter.
The requirements are here: http://elf.cs.pub.ro/poo/arhiva/teme/2016/tema3

I've made 40 unit tests that all principles from Right-BICEP and CORRECT (without Reference).
I couldn't create stubs and fake methods for my project as almost functions return void.
I couldn't change the project in time in order to create them.
I also haven't made test suites.

The tests are in src/JUnitTests.java
